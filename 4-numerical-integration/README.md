# It is used to find the value of a definite integral.

## Steps: 
1. We have to find the intergral of a given function y(x) over (a,b) .
2. Let the number of steps be n i.e. the width of each step is (b - a) / n .
3. We simply evaluate the the value of the function for each step .
4. Let yi be the value of the function for each step i .
5. We now somehow have to use the set of data to evaluate the definite integral of the function.

Let us find the integral of the function 1 / x^2 over (0,1)
